### How does the openfang distribution work?

The openfang distribution consists of two parts:
1. The custom U-Boot that alters the original firmware bootloader to boot from a microsd-card. This part does not contain any custom software, its just allows us to boot from the microsd-card. You only have to do this once.

2. The ROOTFS, which contains the custom software. You will have to install them onto your microsd-card after you completed step 1. You can modify this part easily by changing the files on the microsd-card. 

### Does the openfang contain an RTSP-Server?
Yes, you can watch it through VLC Player.

### Does the openfang connect to the Xiaomi Servers?
No. It does not connect to anything.

### Does the openfang remove the original Firmware?
No. You can still boot the original Software, if you remove the SD-Card.

### Can I run the openfang suite without a microsd?
No that is not possible.

### Can I have full-HD support?
Yes, you can. After installing openfang, you can easily enable it in uEnv.txt.

See [custom bootloader installation](/doc/install.md) for more details.
